My website (www.kelvinism.com) previously ran from Google's AppEngine. This is the code that powered it before moving it to Blogger (so I could use their mobile app).


+ Lookup of books I've read on Goodreads
+ Lookup of books on Amazon and inclusion of referral code
+ Authentication control if we're friends on Facebook (I no longer have an account)
+ Authentication control if you're gmail address is in my contact list
+ Authentication control if we're friends on G+
+ Display of feeds from Disqus
+ Display of recent tweets
+ Creation of thumbnails from Picasa
+ Syndication
+ Listing of posts by what country they were from

Any thoughts on running my site on my own code? I'm glad I moved everything to Blogger, to be honest. Having full control my site allowed me to scratch too many itches - "wouldn't it be neat if I could take the books I've recently read and display them, but include a referral code to Amazon." I should have been focussing on building something for the greater community. I also wish I had followed PEP8 more strictly, and had kept every password out of code (there were only a few, but still bad practice). Gooogle's App Engine has been fantastic to work with; if I didn't need any low level libraries, I would certainly work with it again.
