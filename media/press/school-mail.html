centers.&#8221;

-Miriam Gonzales, ASPSU State and Local Affairs Director, Kelvin Nicholson,
ASPSU University Affairs Director, John Brosy, PSU Advocate, and David
Johnson, Prof. of History all attended the public hearing held on Monday,
April 14 on the higher education budget.

-Scott Bolton, PSU alum and lobbyist with PAC/WEST Communications was
highlighted in last Monday&#8217;s edition of the Statesman Journal.  Clients of
PAC/WEST Communications include:  Oregon Independent Colleges Association,
Central Oregon Cities Organization, Hanford Information Network, Nike, Inc.,
and Pacific Rivers Protection League.

LATEST HIGHER EDUCATION BUDGET CUTS RANGE FROM $37.2 MILLION TO $75 MILLION
Two revised versions of the 2003-2005 biennial General Fund budget presented
Thursday and Friday by the Ways and Means Co-Chairs and Governor Ted
Kulongoski would subtract a minimum of $37.2 million from the OUS Budget
(Governor&#8217;s revised budget) and a maximum of $75 million (Co-Chairs revised
budget).  The two competing revisions are necessary to reduce planned
general fund expenditures to match lowered estimates of revenue for the
upcoming biennium.

More than two-thirds of the Governor&#8217;s recommended reductions ($19.85
million) came from a 2.4 percent reduction in undergraduate instruction, and
7.1 percent reduction in graduate and professional instruction.  The
next-largest reduction came in a proposed $7.15 million reduction to the
Statewide Public Services, a 7.5 percent reduction to the Agricultural
Experiment Station, Extension Service, and the Forest Research Laboratory.
Additionally, the Chancellor&#8217;s Office operations and systemwide expenses
were reduced by $4.59 million, and additional cuts, totaling $5.61 million
were recommended by the Governor from General Fund match for Article XI-G
bonds for campus deferred maintenance and modernization, $2 million from
research support and campus public services, $780,000 from collaborative and
partnership programs, and $340,000 from the OSU-Cascades campus.  The
Governor did add an additional $2.1 to the OUS budget for the &#8220;signature
research center&#8221; now proposed for OSU and UO focusing on nanotechnology.
Thanks to excellent work by Mike Driscoll, Vice Provost for Academic
Personnel and Budget and Bill Feyerherm, Vice Provost for Graduate Studies
and Research, those working on the signature center proposal in the OUS
office are now including PSU in their plans.

The Co-Chairs revised budget, which has a much larger planned &#8220;rainy day
reserve&#8221; than the Governor&#8217;s revised budget and thus requires greater
program reductions in agency budgets, calls for $74.97 million in General
Fund reductions to the 2003-2005 OUS Budget.  The largest element in the
Co-Chair budget reductions was the acceptance of the first 6% in cuts
recommended by the OUS as part of the Ways and Means budget-building
exercise.  The next-largest, and very problematic recommendation, was to
back out $30 million in General Fund, on the assumption that fee remissions
by campuses could be reduced by a similar amount.  The remaining $8 million
was identified as Chancellor&#8217;s Office and campus administrative reductions.
Additionally, the co-chairs budget includes a $450,000 reduction in the
contracts PSU has with the Department of Human Services for research and
training.

No action on any General fund budgets is expected in Ways and Means
subcommittees before the delivery of the May 15 Close of Session Revenue
Forecast.  However, legislators are taking next Friday &#8211; April 25 off for
&#8220;in district&#8221; meetings.  To find out if your legislator is having a town
hall contact Erin Peterschick, alumni advocates intern at:  503-725-8209 or

WAYS AND MEANS EDUCATION SUBCOMMITTEE HOLDS PUBLIC HEARING ON HIGHER
EDUCATION BUDGET
Last Monday, Ways and Means Committee members spent two hours hearing from
the &#8220;public&#8221; on the need for greater investment in higher education.  The
testimony included presentations by student representatives, consumers of
OSU extension services, representatives from unions, and alumni
associations.  The Oregon University System office of government relations
organized most of the two hours of testimony.  Three people affiliated with
PSU testified before the Committee.  Kelvin Nicholson, ASPSU University
Affairs Director talked about the important contribution the State makes in
higher education.  He called for the Legislature to maintain its commitment
to access and affordability.  John Brosy, PSU alum and member of the PSU
Advocates took time out of his work schedule to testify about the need for
an accessible higher education system.  As the parent of a national merit
scholar finalist, Brosy spoke about the need for OUS to maintain its
commitment to serving Oregonians.  Brosy indicated that his daughter will
have many choices for higher education, but he spoke on behalf of the tens
of thousands of students (like himself) who need to have access to an
affordable college degree.  Brosy spoke to the committee about the high
quality education he received at PSU and asked the committee to recommit
itself to the premise of funding all eligible Oregonians, which they adopted
in 1999 when the new Resource Allocation Model was endorsed and funded.

David Johnson, professor of history and chair of the Budget and Priorities
Committee at PSU testified before the Committee as an individual.  He
explained the Committee&#8217;s work so far and discussed the committee&#8217;s
principles for addressing the 03-05 budget process.  Finally, Johnson,
speaking for himself, urged the Committee to (taken directly from his
testimony):

&#183;   Not restrict access to those who wish to pursue a college education and
fund as fully as possible the enrollment of Oregonians at PSU.  PSU is an
engine of social and economic mobility.  I have witnessed this in the lives
of my students hundreds of times since I joined the faculty of PSU in 1979.
This fact about the students of PSU has, more than any other thing, made my
teaching career enormously rewarding.
&#183;   Set no predetermined cap on PSU enrollment. In keeping with the new
funding model and reflecting its mission as a community-based, urban
university, PSU has drawn its enrollment precisely from those groups that
need higher education the most&#8212;first generation college students from lower
socio-economic backgrounds, those juggling the multiple responsibilities of
families and full-time jobs, and individuals improving their skills and
professional preparation for employment in a difficult job market. To
provide access to this under-served population, and, in the process,
stimulate the state's economy, it is vital that all eligible students be
funded and served.
&#183;   Allow the university to offer its own employment benefits program.
Lowering payroll expenses will not only reduce the cost of education for
PSU's paying students but also treat university employees more fairly by
keeping the cost of benefits in line with local market conditions.
&#183;   Free the university from various state rules that are inefficient and
burdensome.  For example, if PSU were allowed to retain its interest
earnings, upwards of $300,000 annually would be available for investment in
educational programs.  These earnings are, after all, students' money.  As
the state asks working students to pay an ever-heavier cost for their public
college education, it is only fair that the state let the interest earned on
student payments contribute to their education as well.
&#183;   Allow the university to issue capital bonds on its own authority, thus
permitting PSU to respond efficiently and in a timely fashion to the growing
demand for its educational and research programs.
&#183;   Finally, I hope that you will even consider allowing PSU to establish
its own governing board, a board that is responsible to the state
legislature and that will have a specific focus on the growth, efficiency,
and excellence of this institution; a board, furthermore, that will be
close--and responsive in a face-to-face sense--to the tuition-paying
students and to the state and metropolitan institutions linked to PSU's
educational and research programs.

Chair Susan Morgan (R-Myrtle Creek) was so impressed with Johnson&#8217;s
testimony that she asked him to prepare a written summary of his remarks and
submit them to the Committee for the official record.

BILL ON RESIDENT TUITION FOR CHILDREN OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS CONSIDERED BY
HOUSE EDUCATION COMMITTEE
The House Education Committee held a hearing on Monday April 14 on SB 10 &#8211; a
bill that seeks to expand access to higher education by children of
undocumented workers.  The Chair, Rep. Vic Backlund allowed 20 minutes for
the proponent and opponents to make their case.   This point-counterpoint
approach allowed proponents and opponents an opportunity to debate the
merits of offering resident tuition rates at OUS campuses to undocumented
students.  Under the measure, introduced by Senate President Peter Courtney,
D-Salem, a student would qualify for instate tuition rates if she or he has
lived in Oregon with a parent or guardian for at least three consecutive
years while attending an Oregon high school, received a high school diploma
or its equivalent, and plans to become a citizen or legal resident alien.
The bill originally passed the Senate on March 19 by a vote of 22 to 8.  The
OUS was invited to testify and David McDonald, Director of Enrollment and
Student Services testified that the numbers of students who would be
eligible for this change in policy would be very small.  He also told the
Committee members that (due to his own experience in adopting a daughter
from Korea), he thought it would be very difficult for students to first
pursue citizenship before enrolling in college. The INS process is now
changing due to Homeland Security issues and the process is unpredictable.
Studies show, McDonald said, that if students don&#8217;t enroll in college within
three years of high school graduation it becomes less likely that a student
will complete a college degree.

The House Education Committee must approve this legislation before the end
of the month or it is considered dead.  PSU Advocates have asked those who
feel strongly about this bill to contact their legislator and request
support.  For more information contact Erin Peterschick at 503-725-8209.

CHILD CARE BLOCK GRANT BILL APPROVED BY HOUSE EDUCATION
On Friday, April 18, 2003, the House Education Committee approved House Bill
3564, which was introduced by Rep. Billy Dalto, R-Salem.  The bill
establishes the childcare assistance program within the Child Care Division
of the Employment Department for childcare assistance to low-income
post-secondary students.  The bill was amended to remove the language
providing for a $1 million appropriation and to remove the &#8220;waiting list&#8221;
provision included in the original bill.  HB 3564 is a companion to Senate
Bill 715, which was approved by the Senate Committee on Human Services and
is now in Ways and Means.  Testimony on this bill was led by Rocky Dallum of
the Oregon Student Association and Rachel Pilliod, OSA President and Student
Body President at the University of Oregon.

BILL TO RESTRICT CLASSES ON SATURDAYS AND HOLIDAYS HEARD
HB 3140, which would prohibit instruction of classes at charter schools,
community colleges or state institutions of higher education on a legal
holiday or Saturday, was heard in the House Education Committee on
Wednesday, April 16.  Representative Cliff Zauner (R-Woodburn) and
Representative Bill Garrard (R-Klamath Falls) introduced the measure.
Representative Zauner and his legislative assistant offered amendments to
the bill, which deleted references to classes on Saturdays, while
maintaining the prohibition of classes on certain holidays.  Lisa Zavala,
assistant director of government relations for the Oregon University System
testified against the bill citing the loss of access opportunities for
students.

FLAT GRANT FORMULA FOR OREGON OPPORTUNITY GRANT PROPOSED
On Monday, April 14 the House Revenue Committee used a tax bill introduced
by Rep. Steve March (D-NE Portland) with a favorable relating clause as a
vehicle to advance a proposal for a flat grant formula to award Oregon
Opportunity Grants to students attending post-secondary institutions.  Rep.
March agreed to the amendment, which establishes a fixed grant to be awarded
to students.  The amount of the grant awarded to a qualified student
enrolled at a community college would be 11 percent of the average total
cost of education at a community college and for students enrolled at
four-year public or private institutions, the amount would be 11 percent of
the average total cost of education at an OUS institution.  The Revenue
Committee adopted the amendments and moved the bill to Ways and Means.

SENATE CONSIDERS BILL THAT REQUIRES SALE OF AGENCY MOTOR POOLS
The Senate General Government Committee held a hearing on Senate Bill 726 on
Wednesday, April 16, 2003.  SB 726 requires state agencies, except the
Oregon Department of Administrative Services, Oregon State University and
the Department of State Police, to sell motor vehicles and use motor pool
vehicles or contract with private sector for use of motor vehicles Senators
Clarno (R-Bend), Beyer (R-Mollala), Ferrioli (R-John Day), Fisher
(R-Roseburg), George (R-Newberg), Harper (R-Klamath Falls), Morse
(R-Corvallis) and Representatives Kropf (R-Lebanon), Kruse (R-Roseburg), T.
Smith (R-Mollala) and Zauner (R-Woodburn) sponsored the bill.  Introduction
of the measure came as a result of a Fleet Management Task Force study
conducted during the 2001-2003 interim, which concluded that efficiencies
could be met through the sale of some agency fleets.  Agencies affected
would be required to sell their standard passenger vehicles to DAS, utilize
DAS motor pool vehicles or contract with a private rental company for
passenger vehicles.  Exemptions were allowed in the bill for trucks or
vehicles specially equipped.    No action was taken on the measure.  PSU has
determined that this bill would not affect any of the vehicles currently
owned by the University.

POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION COUNCIL TASK FORCE APPROVED BY HOUSE EDUCATION
The House Education Committee held a work session on HB 2817, on Friday,
April 18, 2003.  Despite strong objections from the OUS and the Community
Colleges Association over the lack of funding, the bill was amended and
moved to the House floor with a do pass recommendation on a vote of 4-2.
The bill creates the Oregon Post-Secondary Education Council Task Force.
The Committee considered many amendments including several proposed by the
Oregon Independent Colleges Association, the Oregon University System, and
Rep. Steve March.  The OUS amendment would mandate involvement of the
Chancellor on the Task Force, as well as the Commissioner of the Community
College and Workforce office.  The amendment proposed by Rep. March would
have allowed the faculty senate of a postsecondary institution to request
that the Post-Secondary Education Council Task Force appoint a committee to
make recommendations regarding funding and governance options; ways the
institution can increase coordination with other institutions; the role of
the institution in economic development and job creation; and a
determination whether the institution should be independent from the Oregon
University System.

The Committee rejected the OUS amendment, never discussed the March
amendment, and instead amended the bill to remove the $500,000
appropriation, remove independent for-profit institutions from participation
in the task force process and redefined the duties of the task force.
Under the amended bill, the Task Force may solicit and accept moneys from
private sources for the purpose of funding the activities of the task force.

Rep. Brad Avakian (D-Beaverton) explained his opposition to the bill by
saying that he felt having the independent colleges raise money to fund this
study created a conflict of interest and questioned the value of a task
force that did not include leaders in the public university system as
members.

COMPROMISE REACHED ON BILL TO REQUIRE OUS INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE DEBT AND
CREDIT CARD EDUCATION
Oregon University System, the Oregon Students Association and Senator Vickie
Walker, the sponsor of SB 827, reached an agreement on SB 827.   The bill,
had it been adopted by the Senate Education Committee, would have required
OUS institutions to provide debt and credit card education programs to
students during orientation activities.  In lieu of a mandated program,
Senator Walker has asked the campuses to work with the Credit Union
Association (CUA) to provide a coordinated and comprehensive debt management
and credit card education program on the campuses during orientation
activities and throughout the academic year.   Pam Leavitt of the CUA
testified before the committee indicating that the Association would welcome
an opportunity to work with the campuses to provide a comprehensive debt
education program at the campuses.

BILL TO GRANT SPECIAL TAX BREAKS TO VENTURE CAPITALISTS HELD UP IN SENATE
REVENUE
The Senate Revenue Committee held off taking action SB 362 this past week,
though it appears as if a majority of members support the bill and will vote
to move it to the Senate floor this coming week.  The bill, is part of a
package of bills submitted by the Oregon Council for Knowledge and the
Economy (which is staffed by both the Oregon University System and the
Department of Economic and Community Development), provides special tax
incentives to help recruit major venture capitalists to Oregon.  Only
Senator Lenn Hannon (R-Ashland) expressed real concern about the conflict
between the State&#8217;s funding crisis and proposals that reduce tax revenues (a
message he has consistently delivered whenever a tax credit or tax deduction
proposal has been heard by the Committee).  Under the provisions of the
bill, venture capitalists locating in Oregon and making substantial
investments in new start-up companies would qualify for the benefits. There
are two Oregonians who would also meet the stringent requirements of the
bill, however according to testimony both have indicated they would not take
advantage of the benefits offered under SB 362.  The Committee asked
proponents to bring letters from these Oregonians indicating they would not
avail themselves of the tax breaks if the bill is approved.  Once those
letters are delivered, it is assumed that Chair Deckert and chief sponsor o
f the bill will move the bill to the floor for a vote.
