    <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">ASHLAND</font></b><font face="Arial" size="3"> -- At a speechathon Wednesday, Ashland High School students
    practiced arguing in both English and Spanish -- the language they will use
    when they debate students in Cuba next month.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="3">    </font><p><font face="Arial" size="3">The young men and women are headed for the first United States-Cuba high
    school debate to be held in the communist country. The Ashland students
    worked on speeches about five topics they have chosen -- one of which is the
    need to provide Internet access</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">to all
    Cuban students. And although through most of the eight-hour practice the
    students spoke in Spanish, they also demonstrated their English in front of
    media Wednesday.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="3">    </font><p><font face="Arial" size="3">"No society should remain in total isolation from the rest of the
    world," argued Skye Mathieson, a senior. "And no society should be
    in isolation based on the small fears of having its citizens become aware to
    reality."</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="3">    </font><p><font face="Arial" size="3">Seventeen students at Ashland High and 10 others from around the state
    will join in the trip to Cuba on Jan. 18. The trip costs about $1,300 per
    student and many students took pledges for Wednesday's mock debate.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="3">    </font><p><font face="Arial" size="3">Although a deterioration of relations could cancel the trip, organizer
    John Tredway said all indications he's getting from Cuban officials and
    Americans in Cuba remain positive.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="3">    </font><p><font face="Arial" size="3">"We're optimistic Cubans will see this as a way to get their point
    across," he said.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="3">    </font><p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the debate, the Ashland students chose five resolutions to support:
    Internet access available to all Cuban elementary and secondary schools;
    freedom of travel; an increase in baseball exchanges; normalizing diplomatic
    relations between Cuba and the United</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">States;
    and support for the United Nations declaration on human rights.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="3">    </font><p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Cubans also will choose several resolutions. Ashland students expect
    to see the Cuban choices when school resumes in January. Mathieson said he's
    looking forward to the discussions.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="3">    </font><p><font face="Arial" size="3">"It will be interesting to hear well-thought-out arguments on the
    other side," he said.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="3">    </font><p><font face="Arial" size="3">Jan Grauman, a freshman who began the day moderating the debate, said he
    isn't concerned about having to argue in Spanish. He's lived in Mexico and
    Argentina and traveled to Guatemala with medical teams.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="3">    </font><p><font face="Arial" size="3">"Personally, this is the biggest thing I've ever done because Cuba
    is such an incredible place and our relations have been so bad," he
    said. "And we are getting to go there to talk about politics -- it's
    something I'll remember for the rest of my life."</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="3">    </font><p><font face="Arial" size="3">The students are still raising money for the trip. Anyone interested in
    donating can contact Tredway at 482-8771, ext. 170.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="3">    </font><p><font face="Arial" size="3">Tredway noted that checks can be made out to the Ashland Schools
    Foundation, a nonprofit organization, if people want to deduct the donation
    from their taxes.</font>
